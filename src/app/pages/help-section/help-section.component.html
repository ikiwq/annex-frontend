        <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Hello, thanks for checking out my project!</h1>
        <p class="text-md md:text-xl">Hello, I am Chris (aka Iki) and I am a fullstack developer.
            This is Annex, a social media created with Angular, Spring and MySQL. This is my first big project using
            those 2
            frameworks and MySQL.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">Why I chose these tools</h2>
        <p class="text-md md:text-xl">
            In the past I've used React, Express and MongoDB for similar projects. While I still use React and I think
            it is a very valid choice for small-medium works, I think Angular is
            much more complete and has everything to do the job done.<br>
            Backend side, Express was the first backend framework I've ever used and it didn't gave me a very good first
            impression. While it sure works, it felt like a sloppy framework
            with a lot of things missing. Spring on the other hand has every tool imaginabile and I didn't take too much
            time to take the hand of it.
            Comparing it to some other framework like Flask, it has still a bit of boiler plate code, but it isn't a
            tragedy.<br>
            Talking about databases, I think non-relational database are a very solid choice, but I personally prefer
            relational databases. I find them much more
            reliable and scalable.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold">How it was done</h2>
        <p class="text-md md:text-xl">I've organized my backend in various controllers and services.
            Once a request is made, the controllers forward it to the services, where it is elaborated and further
            information is sent back. <br>
            About the authentication side, I've used json web tokens. Before being processed, every request is filtered
            and the authenticity of the token
            is verified.<br>
            The backend has also an image loading system to store images inside the database. Every image is converted
            into bytes and is stored with an unique UUID.
            Frontend side, every aspect of the social network - authentication, posts, profile and more - are managed by
            different angular services.
            I've taken inspiration from the old Twitter layout.
